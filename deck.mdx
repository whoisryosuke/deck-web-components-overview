# Are Web Components the Future?

## What are Web Components?

A combination of 3-4 technologies: 

- [Custom Elements](https://w3c.github.io/webcomponents/spec/custom/)
- [Shadow DOM](https://www.w3.org/TR/shadow-dom/)
- [HTML Templates](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-templates/)
- [Modules (ES6 import/export)](https://github.com/w3c/webcomponents/issues/645)

<Notes>
You've probably had experience with one of these (Shadow DOM with frameworks, or templates and jQuery).

**ES6 Modules** are the only spec that isn't fully implemented yet.

Sometimes paired with **CSS variables** for native global theming, also not fully implemented.
</Notes>

### Custom Elements

These components extend **HTMLElement**.

```js
class MyComponent extends HTMLElement {
  connectedCallback() {
    this.innerHTML = `<h1>Hello world</h1>`;
  }
}
customElements.define('my-component', MyComponent);
```

---

### HTML Templates

A standard template and container for blog posts:

```html
<template id="blog-post-template">
  <li>
    <span class="title"></span> &mdash; <span class="author"></span>
  </li>
</template>

<ul id="blog-posts"></ul>
```

---

### HTML Templates

Using the template in JS to fill the container:

```js
const fragment = document.getElementById('blog-post-template');
const blogPosts = [
  { title: 'The Great Gatsby', author: 'F. Scott Fitzgerald' },
  { title: 'A Farewell to Arms', author: 'Ernest Hemingway' },
  { title: 'Catch 22', author: 'Joseph Heller' }
];

blogPosts.forEach(blogPost => {
  // Create an instance of the template content
  const instance = document.importNode(fragment.content, true);
  // Add relevant content to the template
  instance.querySelector('.title').innerHTML = blogPost.title;
  instance.querySelector('.author').innerHTML = blogPost.author;
  // Append the instance ot the DOM
  document.getElementById('blog-posts').appendChild(instance);
});
```

## Why use Web Components?

100% compability [(except React/Preact)](https://custom-elements-everywhere.com/)

Use inside **HTML**, **Vue**, **Angular**, **React** (*kinda*), and even native apps (using **Ionic**).

Perfect for design systems.

<Notes>
Rather than create 3 separate component libraries in different frameworks (HTML, React, Vue, etc) like other companies have had to do (IBM, Atlassian, etc), create one! Much less overhead, immense reusability.

Platforms like Angular and Vue modeled themselves after the Web Components standard early on, which is why they look similar (with dashed componnet names).
</Notes>

## How do I use Web Components?

Add a script file to your page that imports the components, and then just use them!

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <script src="../test-components.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <test-component></test-component>
</body>
</html>
```

<Notes>No bundling necessary if you didn't use any "future" JS features like decorators.</Notes>

---

### Web Components + React

Web Components use classic JS event listeners to run methods (like opening or closing a modal).


```jsx
export default class MyComponent extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    // Create the ref
    this.dialog = createRef();
    // Bind our method to the instance
    this.onDialogClosed = this.onDialogClosed.bind(this);
  }
  componentDidMount() {
    // Once the component mounds, add the event listener
    this.dialog.current.addEventListener('dialog-closed', this.onDialogClosed);
  }
  render() {
    return
      <one-dialog open={this.state.open} ref={this.dialog}>
        <span slot="heading">Heading text</span>
      </one-dialog>
  }
}
```

<Notes>
I excluded some key code, like super(props), and a lifecycle method that would remove the event listener on component unmount.

I have a code example of a React utility function that sets the ref, attaches event listeners, and handles props (`wc()` function).
</Notes>

### The React Problem

React can't send **object** or **array** values through Web Component props, requiring a `JSON.stringify()` and `JSON.parse()`.

<Notes>
No real solution to this beyond spending the extra computational resources to convert the JSON back and forth.

## Limitations of Web Components

Widely supported in all evergreen browsers and only requires polyfilling in IE11 and older. [The polyfill is available here.](https://github.com/webcomponents/polyfills/tree/master/packages/webcomponentsjs)

Usually uses the shadow DOM, which is fairly supported across browsers, **except for IE11, Edge, and *even* Firefox** (it has it, but requires manual enabling on the user end). This means you will have to polyfill it for those browsers if you plan to use it.

---

## Should I use Web Components today?

**Depends!** Great for base presentational elements, but can be difficult to integrate more complex stateful components into your stack (esp. if using React).

Things only get better and more supported from here:
- [Storybook for Web Components in Alpha](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/next/app/web-components)

And with tooling like Lit-Element or StencilJS, it's fairly approachable to author the components.
